# Geometry

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joppe/geometry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joppe/geometry) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/joppe/geometry/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/joppe/geometry?branch=master) [![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@apestaartje/geometry.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apestaartje/geometry)

This is a collection of geometry utility functions and interfaces written in `TypeScript`. The compiled files and the declaration files 
are available in the `dist` folder. 
Each function is in it's own file, therefore if you want to use one specific function you don't need to import a whole
bunch of unwanted code.
